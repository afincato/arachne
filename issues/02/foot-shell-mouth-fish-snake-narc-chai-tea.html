      <p>When you accepted my submission, the email read: “we like the idea of having club music in the webzine.” I giggled for a moment at this, partly from excitement, and partly at how infrequently I go to clubs - no more than once every few months. I’m creased looks like club music, and might have a function in a club, but I cannot be sure that it is club music.</p>

      <p>To me, it feels more like a casting project. I stared at objects like basslines and drum sequences and represented their shapes. I’m creased is an inelegant sum of specific copies. Like a club track, it attempts to carry the listener through a series of affects across time and to generate a space for dancing. In this capacity, it is flawed. There is just too much happening for it to do this job well. As a visual work, and not just in the sense of having video accompaniment, the song still cannot be taken in simultaneously, as with a painting. But this club is not for the body or the eyes so much as it is for the body of the eyes of ears, tired from the constant left to right and back again, ready to dance and move in and out of focus.</p>

      <p>A moon snail pulls sand in through small openings in its foot, that is mixed with a mucus containing hundreds of eggs. The snail extends its foot outside and around its shell until it is nearly covered and secretes the mixture of sand, eggs and mucus which then hardens, forming a cast of its mother, who escapes by digging below. These sand “collars” remain intact after hatching until they’re washed ashore, dry out, and crumble.</p>
