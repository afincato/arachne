"   Internet users are online information collectors. Looking for information inside the web, they operate in fixed structures, databases and their lists. Lists nowadays function as, or are part of, search interfaces to online information and the online information collector is constantly confronted with them.
  I am interested in the list as a construction of culture that affects the act of (information) collecting through the enforcement of  order. This order could be numerical, chronological, alphabetical, even random. Still I see order as an ideological construct, an outcome of ideologies of effectiveness and productivity within a certain economical system based on knowledge, which demands order in the vast amounts of information that surround us.
  .
 While the online environment offers many possibilities to create dynamic and interesting information spaces, the lists through which databases are accessed, so the way our search results are presented to us, doesn't seem to invest in these potentials.

" 
Humans are  naturally collectors. The technology of the list seems a meaningful and very useful tool. On the one hand supports memory, provides easy and time wise effective access to information.  The list seems to be a material form of classification. Classification is the act of organising things in categories.Is it  information, goods, artworks, ideas, whatever you name it. Classification remains an immaterial mind process if its not written in lists.
  
The list is an information technology and one of the first constructs that emerge following the technology of writing. In fact, some of the first writings of humanity where lists.

<br>
However,  I am looking at it as all technologies and media. It shapes us and constructs us in a certain way. As a medium it becomes a norm through repetition. The list is a culture itself. The culture of organising things in space in clarified and stable ways. And as any culture, is beeing reproduced through individuals, who, of course, find it quite easy to use lists in order to organise themselves and their activities. Moreover within web culture all users became cataloguers and data indexers that are navigating within or creating themselves lists all the time.

"  There is a critical issue with classification related to power and control: who is exercising classification. Rather looking only at the cataloguer, professional or amateur, I find more interesting to look also at who creates cataloguing systems. In my experience a librarian has never the chance to create her own system, she has to always follow the given standards of the adopted by the library system. Librarians are the soldiers of the template choice and lists are their guns.

  In the world of libraries and archives, at least in western culture, two main systems of library classification have been used and adopted by the majority of libraries or similar institutions. The most popular classification system is Dewey Decimal Classification. It was invented by the american librarian, educator, entrepreneur, Melvin Dewey in 1876. Next would come the UDC, Universal Decimal Classification of the belgian information and documentation scientist, and entrepreneur as well, Paul Otlet, published around 1907. 
  The two systems rely on a fixed structure of the first basic categories, which are divided in more subcategories each.  Both Otlet and Dewey have been very passionate and visionary in their field. But on what kind of background did they operate?

 They both have been very early interested in the world of complex information, and its organization, and have been dealing with information science even before its formation as a science related with cybernetics, control and communication.
They were both also involved in business, in fact they have been both selling their catalogue cards and systems. They shared standardization and globalization visions. However, they had mainly social visions, that would be imagining organizational systems of information that would promote communication, knowledge and peace. They seem to have believed that the world would become a complexity of information territory and the power will come together with knowledge. 
 Particularly Paul Otlet was talking about a “collective book” a “universal book of knowledge”. He created the Office International de Bibliography in 1895 together with Henri La Fontaine, an office with a goal to create a universal library, the Mundaneum ,where the classification system of Paul Otlet , UDC, would be applied. The Palais Mondial, which later on became  Mundaneum, opens in  1920.  The institution was in the beginning hosted in the city of Brussels. Its huge collection was accessed through a system of thematic index cards. 

 
Their ideas should be taken into account when we attempt to describe the ideology behind classification systems of our times because they were visions of a proto- web society. The need of a universal language is always present as it seems within the ideas of organization visionaries.  And universal language (is it a classification system, or a museum signing system, or a method of illustrating books), can be constructed only through standardization and institutionalisation. Therefore, the lists that materialise classification systems can be seen as the guards of universal language and institutionalisation of thought, media that enforce systemisation and thinking/acting through template choice standards.

"The web’s information is classified under standards that nowadays are not simply defined by visionary individuals or knowledge institutions, but globalized corporations, particularly the online giants. And on top of this, these corporations affect the process of information collecting by adding their algorithmic filters, which personalize the content based on history, geographic position, identity.
  
The fact the companies like Google are the Classifiers ,alongside with the classificatory nature ot the web, suggests that the web is dependent to  bureaucracy and standardization and that it's a normalizing medium through its standardized classifications. By classifying the world and the self its normalizing them. I refer to the self as we do not only find information within the web about the world. We constantly upload or submit information about ourselves. A  good example would be the user profile. Is it in an operating system, or in social network, user profiles are constructed by lists which materialise classification principles of the providers. Its not only the state anymore, as in the world of Foucault that is involved in the construction of a certain individual, biopolitically constructed. The online corporation stands an extra normalizer. As a provider of content while also a provider of the structures through which users access and see it.  Online companies do not only provide us with what we see but also with the way to look at what is.


In our advanced information societies, we don’t learn only ethical, social or educational classification systems. These systems come mainly from the great systems of belief, religion, politics and culture, the community, or the knowledge institutions. In the online world, the classification systems come mainly from the online giants, so to say corporations. And these systems are bound with the ideas of productive, easy, effective and fast use of information. It Is important to keep in mind that the lists we operate in while collecting information online are there precisely to transform the search experience into a fast, productive and not ambiguous one.  

 As researcher Liam Young (2015)  observes in his essay On Lists And Networks: An Archeology Of Form,  the list is a network and can facilitate networks. It is a fundamental model of a network because it is drawing things together, but also enforces networking through programming action.
 Looking at the beginning of the web, what I find interesting in Young’s statement is that it reminded me a document,  entitled  HTML: A Representation Of Textual Information And MetaInformation For Retrieval And Interchange and written by Tim Berners Lee and Berners Lee  and Daniel Connolly back in 1993. It made me think that the list doesn't exist just within the front end, in the interfaces that people use online. It is a structural element of the web, because it is embedded within programming languages.
 Part of the document defines the design role of the list within HTML:

<BR><BR>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8Rpzz85.png
" alt="listtim" style="width:304px;height:328px;">

<br>
The image documents that the element of the list(LI) and its particular expressions as ordered (OL), unordered (UL), MENU or DIR, are part of the syntax of HTML.  This is important as it shows not only the significance of  the list as a design form of the web through an archeological perspective but also reveals its syntactical nature, which is classificatory. As documented in the image, in HTML there are also unordered lists! Of course here unordered stands for not classified under a number but under a sign or bullet. Additionaly, the opening list tag [...] must be “immediately followed by the first list element”. 



 If we live in a world of information, then the web is the part of the world where all information is ordered.

  Thinking about the list and the interface I realize that the list is an interface. A prototypical interface to collections, a catalogue to access the classified content, an online catalogue of a library. On the other hand it also consists the interface, which is build with a multiplicity of lists in all the levels from the back to the front.
 f the list is an interface but also constitutes it it's important to understand what interfaces are or how we can critique them.

  I want to bring Soren Polds and Christian Ulrik Andersens interface criticism discussion. The authors have been working on a cultural and aesthetic criticism of interfaces.  In their  Manifesto for a Post-Digital Interface Criticism (2014) they point out up some of the core qualities they find in interfaces.
  One of their points is that “the interface is an ideological construct.”  As they note: “ ...[it] reflects a balance of submission and control. This balance is often conditioned by ideology. On some occasions the user is seduced to interact without negotiating this relation” (§3.). As the authors present, interfaces reflect power and control, which in the case of this research is the power of the ones who create classifications, and the ideologies behind their views. 

Search interfaces and their lists of results are ideological designs which embed users within the capitalistic notions of advanced information societies. They enforce the culture of extra productivity, because they are there to offer extremely fast and clarified information recalling. They support the culture of effective use of commodified information, because they do not allow the feeling of hunting of information and of a sense of play. 
And mainly, the enforce ORDER as ideology. The attitude and ways of thinking preserve the idea of  knowledge world and a self beeing in order. Beeing under control. Clarified. Not vague. Thinking in lists, and listing even things that can’t be listed. 

As the authors point out, often times we are seduced to use them without even considering these points. This comes close to the very definition of ideology as an underlying dictation  that functions in a level users do not really understand  , feel or consider, somehow automatically as a script. We perform web searches without acknowledging that we our information experienced are subjected to this information capitalism. We are operating within a loop that enforces the view of the web as just a place for fast and accurate information commodification. The web could though be a playground of information and an online ambiguous space with unexpected possibilities.

"Moreover, a certain (perception of) space is created , which is constituted through the way one navigates within the list but also it formal characteristics.

 Looking at the model of the list in online space and particularly lists of search results, like in online archives and libraries or web indexes, I see it as an expression of a flat online experience. These lists are visually same, and look bureaucratic, therefore they reduce a possible interesting online experience to a very flat one. Flat here should be understood as boring but also as an experience where (the sense of ) space is absent.
The navigation in the list of search results  is simple: going up and down, next and previous page, and picking items. 
  The results are rendered in the form of the fundamental, most basic and simple list. Constructed out of thin, possibly black or grey lines which, by managing free space, constitute boxes that hold words inside. They keep things in the place they should be. These lines create a grid which is a very visual form that a list can take. These lines can be even absent. But they are still there as imaginary lines. 
 Furthermore, the results are  static, nothing moves except our eyes and hand with the mouse, while going from top to down or back to top and from page to page, from left to right or the opposite. The background doesn't move as the boxes don’t move, everything stays in place. The words of course don't move, they are what should remain still at the first place. 
 There is no depth. The background and the surface are both  very two dimensional modules, the one on top of the other. To me, this flatness of the background and of the items, together with the quiet and non movable structure, constitutes precisely the flat online experience. The totality of our senses is somehow excluded. No sounds, no movement.
And additionally, this flatness destroys the feeling of space, one has to navigate linearly and hierarchically in a one surface. The list of search results manages to maintain a non-space experience for the person. Search result pages are information spaces that are treated in this tradition of standardization and bureaucracy with all its political implications and positions.

It also forces as to look at any content the same way.

  Is the world of information a space where we only want to be productive, effective, go, hit, find, use? Or could we have seen the internet as a real space build on and for information?A printed list due to the materiality of its technology cannot provide the sense of depth. However, the online list is designed within an environment that makes possible the manifestation of a space, with characteristics that would consist a spatial and sensual experience. Why this doesn't happen to online search results should be looked also through the history of 3d electronic space to  3d online space and the reasons why they never became  a dominant spatial design model, although they emerged in the early 90s.   
  The work of M. Cooper and the Visible Language workshop of MIT in 1994 “Information Landscapes”,
<br>
  <img src="http://inventinginteractive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/financials_01.gif"  style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <br>
  <img src="http://grahamfoundation.org/system/grants/images/2982/large/06.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">


was a significant contribution for thinking the possibilities of electronic media, information and space. Cooper was a co-founder of the MIT Media lab and was teaching interactive design. The work, a demo of a data visualization proposals, presented a three dimensional textual space of  typography, while investing on the possibilities of interactivity and animation. While the creators bring the elements  of infinite zoom, transparency and live data, the user would navigate in a full three dimensional space, changing his position upon his desire. I am bringing this example in order to explain that ideas related to more interesting and rich information experiences are not new. However, information productivity and standardisation do not allow playful and deep experiences with information. In Information Landscapes the space was purely textual but the navigation possibilities transformed the list notion of space to something much more interesting. As David Reinfurt  writes,  the design was focusing on creating connections and making meaning. In other words,the way information was organised was not investing in clarifying and oversimplyfying but in subjective associations.

The flat online experience doesn't enforce connections, because the fixed spatial arrangement of the list assign things with their fixed relationships. Therefore, such flatness reduces even the possibilities of learning or thinking something new.  It seems to me that approaches like Coopers did not become popular due to efficiency reasons. On the one hand, 3d approaches in the web would be really difficult to handle from the old dial up connections. The tools were also not so easily accessible by a wider audience, that possibly did not have a computer at home.  They would be really time consuming. Additionally,  online information is highly corporate, therefore it is merely a commodity. 
The structures they hold it support the goals of the Classifiers. The simple form of the list materialises and guarantees the commodification of information.

  After all these decades of flat online experiences,  it seems that the tools for a new approach in information organization are accessible, the content is there, and we still insist in the normalized list to see or order information. 

Beeing part or wider community of artists that deal with the networked context, I have witnessing and enjoying the practice of many creatives that are not computer scientists but became self-online-taught web designers. The fact that many of them use programming languages to create online works shows that good amounts of literacy can be acquired online in such a field. Users can still approach their way content and structure, they are just not trained as such.  Moreover, the web is full of content, not only through web indexers but in online archives, libraries and other repositories. All the elements are then there to create new information landscapes, and it seems to me that we do not do it mainly because, as internet users, we operate under the power of repetition.
The popular search interfaces used online  and their lists of results are extremely predetermined, they destroy the sense of play and of the hunting of information, they even destroy the sense of (online) space. The results of a search could be displayed in a much more playful way that would emphasize collecting of information online not as picking items from a list but more as exploring a world of possibilities. 

 

Do we still have the time to see the internet as a space? To oppose to the effects of the list? To respond to flat online experiences?  Do we want that? I think we do.
