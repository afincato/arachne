    <h1>Loving machines</h1>

<h3 class="essay__main--content__author"><em>Dorothy Howard</em></h3>

<p>While scientists will go ahead and define robot intelligence using their own terms, it&#8217;s also true that science, fiction (esp. science fiction), and critical theory have co-evolved in their consideration of the integration of human and machine into hyper-reality, and will likely continue to do so. The cognitive and social sciences interested in human relations might have their own siloed definitions, architecture, and art are the disciplines primarily interested in object relations, and the relationship between humans and objects. </p>

<p>Speculations on human and machine Intimacy deserve a multidisciplinary approach. </p>

<p>Lauren Berlant’s terms of ‘queering love,’ recognizing how a sincere queering of love, opening it up to machinic-intimacy, might be prone to falling into the very traps of exploitation and appropriation which queer theory seeks to avoid. </p>

<p>Many who have noticed how the question of how far we can advance machines tends to become also a question of how realistic we can make pornography. This concern is part of a strain of theory that worries that love felt towards technology is a result of an acceptance of the alienation of machines on identity– using Jean-François Lyotard&#8217;s term, our libidinal investments– psychic motivations, which push for desire fulfillment, </p>

<p>Recognizing that we need new narratives outside the trope of the technofetishistic cyborgian sexbot, </p>

<h2>Planes of Intimacy</h2>

<p>Desire beyond humanity was the central theme of Spike Jonze&#8217;s Her (2014), a L.A. science fiction romantic comedy which asked us to consider Joaquin Phoenix’s character Theodore’s seduction by his operating system Samantha played by Scarlett Johansson. The society Jonze imagines conjures up techno-futurist and Director of Engineering at Google, Ray Kurzweil&#8217;s zany body of work, which explores automation and machine learning including steps in optical character recognition (OCR). For Kurzweil, the technological singularity is near; i.e. the moment where machine intelligence exceeds human intelligence– but it&#8217;s happening gradually, and also by augmentation of the human body, or the ‘robotic imagination’ of the OS, rather than co-evolution of a separate intelligence. </p>

<p>Dramatic tension in the Her hinges on the comparison of Samantha with a hypothetical real, human, lover. In Kurzweil’s review of the film, he argues that the main conflict of the film is that Samantha doesn’t have a body when such technologies currently exist, including eye-mounted displays that project images onto the wearer’s retinas. For a contemporary example of this method, in <a href="http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/63210373523/stay-with-hatsune-miku-in-ar-environment-virtual">Stay with Hatsune Miku in AR environment</a> “the virtual girlfriend” an Oculus Rift + Kinect sensor, put together by alsione svx, which projects the humanoid persona pop star onto the wearer’s everyday life. While Theodore’s struggle in the film paints the image that machinic love in its most ideal state, would look like, feel like, and sound like, human love, it’s hardly as simple as that given that emotional closeness with machines can be experienced at many levels.</p>

<p>Why is the question of robot intelligence always a question of whether we will lose our humanity instead of a question of what new forms of intimacy are we creating? The question of whether machines are intelligent is a separate question from whether we can love machines. Indeed, the growth of consumer products in the internet of things and augmentation technologies– networked but also existing in concrete objects– has made it more difficult to be so anthropocentric in our definitions of love. Martin Heidegger writes of technology as an instrumentation located in ideas rather than in devices themselves so that the iPad might be thought of as a cluster of technologies being utilized, rather than a technology of itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools, and machines, the manufactured and used things themselves, and the needs and ends that they serve, all belong to what technology is. The whole complex of these contrivances is technology. Technology itself is a contrivance, or, in Latin, an instrumentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The Question Concerning Technology, and Other Essays (1977</em>) </p>

<p>When the feeling of loving a machine registers, is that love found in the appreciation of the object independent of ourselves, or as an assistive technology, which helps us fulfil or express our desires? One ancient relationship between a human and a technology is the musician to their instrument. A 2013 article in SourceWire indicated that a common sentiment of the musician separated from the instrument is feelings of “loss” and “devastation,” mentioning also a 2013 study by the University of Finland’s Cognitive Brain Research Unit where “results showed that many musicians express a close relationship with their musical instrument, with those feeling ‘at one’ with and considering the instrument as ‘part of themselves’ experiencing more confidence and less anxiety when performing.”</p>

<p>When my computer caught a virus last year, I felt physically sick myself. Part of this is perhaps related to identity and the intense personalization that is available to us through devices, when the augmentation is made available and becomes a site of personal expression, anything else seems like deprivation. </p>

<p>Then there is another form of intimacy, that felt between the self and the broken machine. The spiderweb of broken glass of the still-functional cell phone screen is a regular site, the cracks trigger both anxiety and thoughts about the device’s mediation of the world. Wrecked Apple devices in particular can be found at every corner of the internet. The Youtube video “Why would you do this to an awesome iPad” an ‘iPad vs. powertools’ video for example, has over 3 million views and stream of agonized comments that express a mixture of pleasure and pain. There are videos like, “iPad in HOT LAVA.” These videos are the post-jackass response to ‘unwrapping’ videos made for packaging lovers, which delicately remove objects from their original boxes and plastics. These videos don’t just enact cultural catharsis at the destruction of one of the most repetitive symbols in modern life, the public horror expressed in these videos makes obvious our cult-like fetishization of their original ‘purity/sanctity’ of the phone. This happened with our plastic flip phones, but with the all-glass exterior of the iPhone, things have gotten more intense. From the sleek, Titanium body of the MacBook, to the company’s push to replace keyboards with touchscreens, it’s as if Apple wants to make its devices melt into their surroundings, into the body and made the technical aspects of the device altogether invisible. </p>

<p>The more ubiquitous a medium of communication, the more it tends to disappear in our recognition of the fact that it is a mediating experience at all. Nostalgic or vintage mediums tend to be especially laden, as do recent innovations. This is why sending an email or writing a Facebook message to a friend feels so much less laden with intentionality that has to be managed, than dinosaur technology like sending a fax. But there’s a demand for the most ubiquitous modes of communication to <em>disappear</em>, because disappearance of the medium increases the speed of communication by making it the most common denominator. This is Paul Virilio’s argument in <em>The Aesthetics of Disappearance</em>. Post-internet art was interesting, if nothing else, because it symbolized the idea of human thought merging with the machine and disappearing, taking the machine for granted, perhaps as “nature,” an idea which has pervasively existed as a conversation on the horizon of technological innovation.</p>

<h2>Radical Political Potential of Loving Machines</h2>

<p>In a May 2011 blog post, disability scholar Mia Mingus explored the idea of <em>access intimacy</em>, when someone ‘gets’ your access needs, and your needs are met, you are able to relax and open up. She writes of access provisioning as a powerful framework for understanding relationships outside of political intimacy, sexual attraction, and romantic desire, where emergent technologies to improve our access needs can be applied to new forms of intimacy. </p>

<p>One example might be translation software for languages we don’t know, and other, process documentation as an intimacy formed between the producer of forms, and the consumer who wants to replicate a process. </p>

<p>Anthropocentrism is binary and ableist in that it allows for (discrimination against trans, otherkin, multiples, schizo, augmented). What would it mean to get away from a bodily/ genital-based definition of intimacy? Acceptance of machines as extensions of self might be described as a process of de-anthropocentric take on love. In “<em>No One is Sovereign in Love: A Conversation between Lauren Berlant and Michael Hardt</em>,” conducted by Heather Davis and Paige Sarlin in 2011, the two describe the potential for the language of love/ intimacy to be used to represent political strategies which represent a radical acceptance of the unknown. Love as an act of fantasy, imagination, an acceptance of the un-sovereignty, incoherence, and multiplicity of life. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The thing I like about love as a concept for the possibility of the social, is that love always means non-sovereignty. Love is always about violating your own attachment to your intentionality, without being anti-intentional. I like that love is greedy. You want incommensurate things and you want them now. And the now part is important.</p>

<p>When you plan social change, you have to imagine the world that you could promise, the world that could be seductive, the world you could induce people to want to leap into. But leaps are awkward, they’re not actually that beautiful. When you land you’re probably going to fall, or hurt your ankle or hit someone. When you’re asking for social change, you want to be able to say there will be some kind of cushion when we take the leap. What love does as a seduction for this is, and has done historically for political theory, is to try to imagine some continuity in the affective level. One that isn’t experienced at the historical, social or everyday level, but that still provides a kind of referential anchor, affectively and as a political project.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The layers of Freudian theory onto which so much of speculative, contemporary theory has been crafted might make this difficult. Jean-François Lyotard’s notion of <em>The Libidinal Economy</em>, based around Sigmund Freud&#8217;s theory of the libido, points to libidinal energy– psychic motivations leading us towards sex– as the driving factor for societal transformations, similiar to Deleuze and Guttari’s notion of the mechanization of the production of the social out of human desire. </p>

<h2>Dildotectonics</h2>

<p>Does sleeping with your laptop make you feel less alone? There are many types of intimacy; physical, intellectual, political, sexual, familial. Intimacy can be scientific biological, psychological, literary depending on your frame of reference, but fundamentally it is the study of relations which lead to a closeness felt and expressed by an ease of relations, a sense of confidence among subjects, an understanding.</p>

<p>Theorist Paul B. Preciado’s “<a href="http://www.anagrama-ed.es/PDF/fragmentos/A_424.pdf">Contrasexual Manifesto</a>” posits new forms of sex considerations after we accept that gender has become a tool of capitalism: a sort of de-centering sex away from the genitals, de-centering love away from the brain / heart “consciousness,” in recognition of the way that sex is a product of the state management of reproduction and sexuality– condoms, Viagra and performance medicine, birth control, and testosterone– politically charged in their manifestation of ideology at the molecular level. Dildotectonics then, is a performance-based practice she labels as resistance: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dildotectonics is the experimental contra-science dedicated to the study of the birth, formation and uses of the dildo. Here the term dildo designates all kinds of technologies of gender and sex that resist the normative production of the body and its pleasures. Dildotectonics’ aim is to draw a general cartography of the cracks and slippages inflicted by the dildo on the hegemonic sex-gender system. To make dildotectonics a critical branch of contra-sexuality is to consider the body as a dildoscape: a living surface where dildos are inscribed and displaced… Dildotectonics locates gender and sexual technologies of resistance. It studies their functioning, the ways in which they interrupt the flow of production of body-pleasure-capital not only within heterosexual but also within queer cultures. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Capitalism’s Interest in the Queer: The Colonialism of Machine Anthropomorphism</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/13/greater-transgender-visibility-hasnt-helped-nonbinary-people-like-me?CMP=share_btn_tw">Greater transgender visibility hasn’t helped nonbinary people like me</a>” read a headline by writer Alok Vaid-Menon in <em>The Guardian</em>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prof. Jordana Rosenburg’s essay, critique of self-called ‘movement’ of object oriented ontology brought to my attention in Alexander Galloway&#8217;s October 21, 2014 blog post &#8216;<a href="http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/queer-atonality">Queer Atonality</a>&#8217; address the recent trend towards what she calls &#8220;molecular ontologies,&#8221; or philosophical queerings, found in object-oriented onotology, speculative realism, new materialism, and post-internet art. Rosenburg addresses these various theoretical approaches, how &#8220;onto-primitivism,&#8221; seen in anti-Kantian Graham Harman’s “speculative realism,” Timothy Morton’s <em>Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World</em> (2013), and paper, “Queer Ecology,&quot; as well as the writings of Ian Bogost, and Bruno Latour, push for an all-embracing philosophical queerness has a greedy appetite over cultural forms within a state of both indeterminacy and overdetermination, that they risk emptying the term of any real meaning. </p>

<p>Object oriented ontology copied the frameworks of feminism and queer studies without giving credit. Still, radical theories against anthropocentrism like Timothy Morton’s <em>Hyperobjects</em> push all-embracing queerness in written texts which becomes so open and undetermined as it expands as to empty the term of any real meaning, or worse poise themselves to reveal globalization and global warming through an acceptance of material realities. These theories insulate themselves among a concentrated elite institutions and white-male gaming communities. </p>

<p>Rosenburg questions to dangers of appropriation, whether the popularization of gender fluidity contributes to a loss of context for the subject that most deeply identifies as queer. Her critique is in a tradition of methodologies poised to reveal the relationship between globalization and queer / feminist studies. This mode asks us to consider how identity acceptance under capitalism can be read as the opening up new market possibilities for capitalism and commodities, rather than a sort of emancipation from gender categories, as if gender fluidity specifically appeals to capitalism. Queerness has become synonymous with &quot;openness,” open sourcing, where gender acceptance happens alongside globalization– globalization pushing identity acceptance as a way of spurring competition while increasing potential points of contact. We don’t want/ need to ‘queer’ everything. The dangers of appropriation include the loss of meaning to those who most deeply identify. </p>

<p>At their best, theorists can speculate about technology in ways scientists could not – Charlie Chaplin went to the depths of the modern factory and the mechanizations of the body in <em>Modern Times</em> (1936) without studying engineering, we can only know what we know now.</p>
