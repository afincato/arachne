A zine about gender, labour and technology.

### Colophon

The site is just handwritten HTML pages and a `style.css`.
We decided not to make use of a CMS because we wanted to directly mark the text articles up with tags, since the editorial process is also that.

Typography is set to [Liberation](http://usemodify.com/fonts/liberation/) for the body text, whereas articles' headlines and the main title are set to [Autopia](http://autopia-type.tumblr.com).

For micro-donations we're using both using flattr and paypal.
